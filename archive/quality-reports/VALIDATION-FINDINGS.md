## 1. Luxury Brands Analysis (4,340 records)

### Coverage Distribution

| Insurers | Records | % of Total | Assessment |
|----------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 2,395 | **55.2%** | ⚠️ High single-insurer |
| 2-4 | 1,341 | 30.9% | ✓ Moderate coverage |
| 5+ | 604 | 13.9% | ✓ Good coverage |

**Key Finding**: Over half of luxury vehicles (55.2%) have single-insurer coverage, suggesting potential for improved matching.

### By Brand

| Brand | Records | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Porsche | 3,405 (78.5%) | Dominant luxury brand |
| Maserati | 278 | Limited coverage |
| Ferrari | 267 | Very specialized |
| Tesla | 232 | Growing electric segment |
| Lamborghini | 158 | Ultra-luxury niche |

### Single-Insurer Distribution

**Top sources of unique luxury vehicles:**
1. **Qualitas**: 460 records (19.2%)
2. **BX**: 454 records (19.0%)
3. **Mapfre**: 432 records (18.0%)
4. **GNP**: 368 records (15.4%)
5. **Zurich**: 214 records (8.9%)

**Interpretation**: Qualitas, BX, and Mapfre are primary sources for unique luxury vehicles, suggesting they have specialized catalogs for high-end vehicles.

### Recent Models (2020+)

- **Total**: 1,047 records (24.1% of luxury segment)
- **Implication**: Recent luxury models are well-represented but still show fragmentation

### Quality Issues Identified

#### 1. **Ferrari 296 Duplication Pattern**
```
Ferrari 296 2022-2025: Same version repeated across years
- Version: "GTB COUPE 6CIL 3.0L TURBO PHEV 2PUERTAS 2OCUP"
- Source: Qualitas only
- Issue: Minimal variation between model years
```

**Potential Issue**: These could be matched together if year tolerance was applied, but current system strictly separates by year.

#### 2. **Version Granularity**
Examples of well-matched luxury vehicles:
- Maserati Levante 2019: 5 insurers (good)
- Porsche 911 variants: 5 insurers (good)

Examples of poor matching:
- Ferrari 360 Modena 2000: 3 separate single-insurer versions
  - "MODENA COUPE 3.6L" (BX)
  - "FORMULA 1 2OCUP" (Qualitas)
  - "6VEL 2OCUP" (Qualitas)

**Root Cause**: Different insurers use completely different naming conventions for same vehicle.

## 2. Critical Vehicle Families Analysis (4,600 records)

### Coverage Distribution - **⚠️ CONCERN**

| Insurers | Records | % of Total | Status |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 3,217 | **69.9%** | ⚠️ Very high single-insurer |
| 2-4 | 1,310 | 28.5% | Moderate |
| 5+ | 73 | 1.6% | Very low |

**Critical Finding**: Nearly 70% of pickup/commercial vehicles have single-insurer coverage - **much worse than catalog average (56.9%)**.

### By Model Family

| Model | Records | Avg Coverage | Single-Insurer % |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| RAM (all variants) | 3,035 | 1.5 | **70.8%** |
| SILVERADO (all) | 1,041 | 1.4 | **76.4%** |
| F-150 | 278 | 1.6 | 46.8% |
| TACOMA | 246 | 2.4 | 58.5% |

**Key Insight**: RAM and Silverado families show poorest matching - average coverage around 1.4-1.5 insurers.

### Single-Insurer Sources

**Top sources for unique pickup/commercial vehicles:**
1. **GNP**: 847 records (26.3%)
2. **Chubb**: 517 records (16.1%)
3. **Atlas**: 465 records (14.5%)
4. **ANA**: 440 records (13.7%)
5. **BX**: 302 records (9.4%)

**Interpretation**: GNP and Chubb specialize in commercial/pickup vehicles - their catalogs contain many variants not found elsewhere.

### Recent Models (2020+) - **⚠️ CONCERN**

| Coverage | Records | % of Recent |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 insurer | 699 | **65.2%** |
| 2 insurers | 198 | 18.5% |
| 3 insurers | 118 | 11.0% |
| 4-8 insurers | 57 | 5.3% |

**Critical**: Even recent pickup models (2020+) show 65% single-insurer coverage - **worse than overall average**.

### High Coverage Examples (7+ insurers)

Only **27 records** achieved 7+ insurer coverage out of 4,600 (0.6%).

**Best performers:**
- Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport variants (2006-2013): 7-8 insurers
- Consistent naming across insurers enables good matching

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

### Why Luxury Brands Have Better (but still poor) Matching:

1. **More standardized naming** for high-end models
2. **Fewer trim variations** compared to commercial vehicles
3. **Specialized insurers** (Qualitas, BX, Zurich) focus on luxury segment

### Why Pickups/Commercial Vehicles Fail to Match:

#### A. **Model Name Fragmentation**
```
Same vehicle, different names:
- "RAM 2500" (Dodge)
- "PICK UP RAM" (Chrysler)
- "RAM" (standalone)

Similar for Silverado:
- "SILVERADO 2500"
- "PICK UP SILVERADO"
- "SILVERADO C 2500"
```

**Impact**: Hash-based matching (`marca|modelo|anio|transmision`) creates separate groups.

#### B. **Version String Diversity**
Different insurers describe same pickup completely differently:
- Technical focus: "4CIL 2.5L TURBO 4PUERTAS"
- Trim focus: "LT CREW CAB 4X4"
- Feature focus: "CUSTOM STD A/AC"

**Impact**: Token overlap fails when vocabularies don't align.

#### C. **Commercial Vehicle Complexity**
Pickups have many configuration dimensions:
- Cab type (Regular, Extended, Crew)
- Bed length (Short, Standard, Long)
- Drivetrain (2WD, 4WD, 4X4)
- Trim level (Base, LT, LTZ, etc.)
- Weight class (1500, 2500, 3500)

**Impact**: Creates exponential version variations that fragment across insurers.

## 4. Impact Assessment

### Current State

| Segment | Total Records | Single-Insurer % | Multi-Insurer % | Assessment |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Overall Catalog** | 134,332 | 56.9% | 43.1% | ✓ Baseline |
| **Luxury Brands** | 4,340 | 55.2% | 44.8% | ✓ Slightly better |
| **Pickups/Commercial** | 4,600 | **69.9%** | **30.1%** | ⚠️ Significantly worse |

### Business Impact

1. **Client Perspective**:
   - Luxury segment: Acceptable coverage for high-value vehicles
   - Commercial segment: **Poor coverage for high-volume vehicles** (fleet insurance market)

2. **Coverage Gaps**:
   - RAM family: 70.8% single-insurer (2,148 orphaned versions)
   - Silverado family: 76.4% single-insurer (795 orphaned versions)
   - **Combined**: ~3,000 commercial vehicle versions lack cross-insurer matching

3. **Insurer-Specific Catalogs**:
   - GNP: 847 unique commercial vehicles
   - Chubb: 517 unique commercial vehicles
   - **Opportunity**: These represent potential matching targets

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### A. **Model Name Normalization Enhancement**

**Problem**: "RAM 2500" ≠ "PICK UP RAM" ≠ "RAM" in hash calculation

**Solution**: Add pre-processing step to normalize model names:

```javascript
function normalizeModelName(marca, modelo) {
  let normalized = modelo.toUpperCase().trim();

  // Remove generic prefixes
  normalized = normalized.replace(/^PICK\s*UP\s+/gi, '');
  normalized = normalized.replace(/^CAMIONETA\s+/gi, '');

  // Standardize RAM variants
  if (marca.toUpperCase().includes('DODGE') || marca.toUpperCase().includes('CHRYSLER')) {
    if (/RAM\s*\d+/.test(normalized)) {
      normalized = normalized.replace(/RAM\s*(\d+)/, 'RAM $1');
    }
  }

  // Standardize Silverado variants
  if (normalized.includes('SILVERADO')) {
    normalized = normalized.replace(/SILVERADO\s*C\s*(\d+)/, 'SILVERADO $1');
  }

  return normalized;
}
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce pickup single-insurer rate from 69.9% to ~55% (catalog average)

#### B. **Commercial Vehicle Synonym Dictionary**

Add commercial vehicle-specific token synonyms to SQL matching:

```sql
-- In funcion-multiples-estrategias.sql
commercial_synonyms := ARRAY[
    ARRAY['CREW', 'DOBLE', 'DOUBLE'],           -- Cab types
    ARRAY['REGULAR', 'SENCILLA', 'SINGLE'],
    ARRAY['4X4', '4WD', 'AWD', 'CUATRO'],       -- Drivetrain
    ARRAY['CAJA', 'BED', 'CORTA', 'SHORT'],     -- Bed types
    ARRAY['CAJA', 'BED', 'LARGA', 'LONG']
];
```

**Expected Impact**: Increase token overlap scores for commercial vehicles by ~15-20%

#### C. **Threshold Adjustment for Commercial Vehicles**

Current thresholds may be too strict for pickup/commercial segment:

```sql
-- Consider lowering TIER3 threshold for commercial vehicle patterns
IF version_tokens && ARRAY['PICKUP', 'CREW', 'CAB', 'BED', '4X4', '2WD'] THEN
    -- More lenient matching for commercial vehicles
    tier3_threshold := 0.30;  -- vs 0.40 standard
END IF;
```

**Expected Impact**: Increase multi-insurer matching by 5-10% for commercial segment

### Medium-Term Improvements

#### D. **Ferrari/Luxury Year Tolerance**

For luxury brands with minimal year-over-year changes:

```sql
-- Allow year +/-1 matching for luxury brands with identical specs
IF marca IN ('FERRARI', 'LAMBORGHINI', 'MCLAREN') AND
   token_overlap >= 0.95 AND
   ABS(anio_existing - anio_incoming) <= 1 THEN
    -- Consider match
END IF;
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce Ferrari/exotic duplicates by ~20%

#### E. **Insurer-Specific Normalization**

Add specialized cleaning for insurers with unique patterns:
- **GNP commercial catalog**: Extra tonnage/capacity normalization
- **Qualitas luxury catalog**: Trim code standardization
- **Chubb commercial**: Configuration type normalization

### Long-Term Strategy

#### F. **Machine Learning Similarity Model**

Train model on confirmed matches to learn:
- Brand-specific naming patterns
- Insurer vocabulary differences
- Commercial vehicle configuration equivalencies

**Expected Impact**: Could improve overall matching by 10-15%
